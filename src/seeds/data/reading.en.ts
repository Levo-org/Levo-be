Sea turtles, for example, often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them. Fish and seabirds also consume small pieces of plastic called microplastics. These tiny particles can enter the food chain and eventually affect humans. Governments around the world are starting to take action. Some countries have banned single-use plastic bags, and many organizations are working to clean up beaches and oceans.

    difficulty: 'advanced',
    content:
      'Artificial intelligence is transforming industries from healthcare to finance, but its rapid advancement raises profound ethical questions. One major concern is algorithmic bias. AI systems learn from historical data, and if that data reflects existing prejudices, the AI may perpetuate or even amplify discrimination. For example, studies have revealed that some facial recognition systems have significantly higher error rates for people with darker skin tones. Another issue is accountability. When an autonomous vehicle causes an accident, determining who is responsible — the manufacturer, the programmer, or the AI itself — becomes a complex legal and philosophical problem. There is also growing anxiety about job displacement, as automation threatens to replace millions of workers in fields ranging from manufacturing to customer service. Experts argue that establishing clear ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks is essential to ensure that AI benefits society as a whole rather than deepening existing inequalities.',

      'Every day, humans make thousands of decisions, from trivial choices like what to eat for breakfast to life-changing ones like choosing a career. Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky pioneered research showing that human decision-making is far less rational than previously believed. Their work identified two systems of thinking: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and emotional, and System 2, which is slow, deliberate, and logical. Most everyday decisions rely on System 1, which uses mental shortcuts called heuristics. While heuristics are efficient, they can lead to systematic errors known as cognitive biases. Confirmation bias, for instance, causes people to favor information that supports their existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. The anchoring effect demonstrates how initial information disproportionately influences subsequent judgments. Understanding these biases does not eliminate them, but awareness can help individuals make more thoughtful and informed decisions.',

Quantum computers, however, use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a phenomenon called superposition. This allows quantum computers to explore many possible solutions at once, making them potentially millions of times faster than classical computers for certain problems. Another key principle is entanglement, where two qubits become linked so that the state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance. While quantum computers show enormous promise for drug discovery, cryptography, and complex optimization problems, significant technical challenges remain.

Consumer prices have also decreased as companies source materials and labor from countries with lower production costs. However, critics point out that globalization has contributed to widening income inequality within nations. Manufacturing jobs in developed countries have been outsourced to regions with cheaper labor, devastating local communities.

    title: 'The Philosophy of Happiness',
    difficulty: 'advanced',
    content:
      'The pursuit of happiness has been a central theme in philosophy for millennia. Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that true happiness, or "eudaimonia," is achieved not through pleasure but through living a virtuous and purposeful life. In contrast, the utilitarian tradition founded by Jeremy Bentham proposed that happiness is essentially the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain. Modern positive psychology, led by researchers like Martin Seligman, has attempted to study happiness scientifically. Seligman\'s PERMA model identifies five elements that contribute to well-being: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement. Research consistently shows that beyond a certain income level, additional wealth has diminishing returns on happiness. Instead, strong social connections, a sense of purpose, and acts of kindness appear to be more reliable predictors of lasting satisfaction. The philosophical debate continues, but the evidence increasingly suggests that happiness is less about what we have and more about how we live.',

    title: 'The Microbiome and Human Health',
    difficulty: 'advanced',
    content:
      'The human body hosts trillions of microorganisms collectively known as the microbiome, with the largest concentration found in the gut. These bacteria, fungi, and viruses are not merely passive inhabitants; they play crucial roles in digestion, immune system regulation, and even mental health. Research has revealed a complex communication pathway between the gut and the brain, often called the gut-brain axis. Studies suggest that an imbalanced gut microbiome may contribute to conditions ranging from obesity and diabetes to depression and anxiety. Diet significantly influences microbiome composition. Diets rich in fiber, fermented foods, and diverse plant-based ingredients tend to promote a healthy and diverse microbial community. Conversely, highly processed foods and excessive antibiotic use can deplete beneficial bacteria. The emerging field of microbiome therapy, including fecal microbiota transplants and targeted probiotics, offers promising new approaches to treating a variety of diseases that were previously difficult to manage.',

      'The question of whether humanity should invest heavily in space exploration has sparked intense debate among scientists, policymakers, and the public. Advocates argue that space exploration drives technological innovation, with countless everyday technologies — from GPS to memory foam — originating from space research. Furthermore, establishing human settlements on other planets could serve as an insurance policy against existential threats such as asteroid impacts, pandemics, or nuclear conflict. NASA and private companies like SpaceX have outlined ambitious plans to send humans to Mars within the next two decades. Critics, however, contend that the enormous financial resources required for space missions would be better spent addressing urgent problems on Earth, including poverty, climate change, and healthcare. They argue that it is morally questionable to pursue interplanetary colonization while millions lack basic necessities. Ultimately, the debate reflects deeper questions about human ambition, responsibility, and our place in the universe.',
